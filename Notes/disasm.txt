Each instruction contains:
- A disassembly descriptor
 > Name, params, format
- Microcode list
 > List of microcode operations (with a few params)


Microcode:
- All microcode ops contain these functions
 > Print
 > RunForwards (input is previous state, output is next state)
 > RunBackwards (input is next state, output is previous state)
